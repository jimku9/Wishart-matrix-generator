### Wishart matrix generator for OX
This code is written and for use in OX, which includes the random Wishart and inverse-Wishart matrix generator and their probability density functions. Detail about the work can be found in [Generating Random Wishart Matrices with Fractional Degrees of Freedom in OX](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267417344_Generating_Random_Wishart_Matrices_with_Fractional_Degrees_of_Freedom_in_OX).
